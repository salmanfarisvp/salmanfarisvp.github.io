During the initial week of October, an incredible in-person workshop took place at Robu.in. Renowned as one of the largest e-commerce platforms for electronics, Robu offers an extensive range of Seeed components. Our workshop was meticulously designed to elevate the skills of Robu employees through a hands-on experience with the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense in a dedicated tinyML Workshop. It also served as an excellent opportunity to familiarize participants with other innovative XIAO and Seeed products.
