We\'ve always wanted to give back in a meaningful way.\\n\\nOne question we often hear from fellow makers is: **\u201cWhere can I find upcoming events, contests, or opportunities?\u201d** The truth is, this information is often scattered across the internet. That\u2019s what inspired us to create Solder Junction, a single place to bring it all together and keep our community informed, inspired, and connected.\\n\\n## A New Beginning\\n\\nBetween October 2020 and January 2022, [we published 13 issues of our community newsletter, MakerGram Live](http://web.archive.org/web/20220930021053/https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=c46723a04a3a8e6fa328d1ddd&id=b9308c5cc6), filled with events, project updates, and opportunities for makers. But over time, as things got busy, we had to pause. Unfortunately, due to the long period of inactivity, we lost all the content from that previous newsletter a sad outcome, but also a valuable lesson.\\n\\nSo today, we\u2019re making a fresh start with a new name, new platform, and renewed purpose.\\n\\n## Introducing Solder Junction \ud83d\udd0c\u2728\\n\\nThis is our new community newsletter, built on Substack, designed to be open, accessible, and easier to maintain long-term.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc47 Read the first issue here\\n\\n<div class=\\"substack-post-embed\\"><p lang=\\"en\\">#1 \ud83d\ude80 Welcome to \\"Solder Junction\\" : News, Builds, and Everything Makers Love by MakerGram</p><p>Issue 01 - June:July 2025 </p><a data-post-link href=\\"https://makergram.substack.com/p/1-welcome-to-solder-junction-news\\">Read on Substack</a></div><script async src=\\"https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js\\" charset=\\"utf-8\\"><\/script>\\n\\nWe\u2019re bringing back everything that made the original newsletter special and updated it with the latest happenings in the maker community.\\n\\nI wanted to share this with you, and I hope you find it useful.

We explored how it works from the atomic level, relating it to what they learned about atoms and electrons in school. From there, we spun a mini-motor \u274b with some paper attached, sparking excitement as simple components came to life.\\n\\n![Salman session](../static/img/blog/2025-04-19-ilab-tinkerspace-event/salman-session.JPG)\\n\\nTwo kids were joined by their parents, who were equally curious and excited. So, we handed out batteries, LEDS, and motors for them to experiment with too\u2014 it\'s so happy to see them also enjoying and lighting an LED \ud83d\ude04.\\n\\n![Salman helping students](../static/img/blog/2025-04-19-ilab-tinkerspace-event/Salman-helping-students.JPG)\\n\\n\\nLater, we gave the students a task: blink an LED manually by disconnecting and reconnecting the battery \ud83d\udd0b. After trying it a few times, I asked them to do it 1000 times. That\'s when the spark hit\u2014they understood the why behind automation and how technology helps us make life easier. Then Nadec Biju shared about Arduino in Tinkercad Education simulation and block programming, and gave tasks like changing LED blinking frequency, etc.\\n\\n![Nadec Session](../static/img/blog/2025-04-19-ilab-tinkerspace-event/Nadec-session.JPG)\\n\\nThese sessions aren\'t about turning kids into electronics wizards overnight. That\'s not our goal. Our mission is to ignite curiosity and help them realise they can do this too. And more importantly, there\'s a whole community ready to support their journey.\\n\\nWe also have an Introduction to AI session by Alosh Denny \ud83d\ude4c - where the students learn about AI, and how it\'s working under the hood, and they made their first AI model with Google Teachable Machine tool, Kudos to Alosh! .\\n\\n![Alosh AI Session](../static/img/blog/2025-04-19-ilab-tinkerspace-event/alosh-session.JPG)\\n\\nAnd then we had our Design session by Niyas V \ud83d\udc4f where he talked about the importance of design, UI and UX of things and introduced us to the tools. Unfortunately, Lazim Aslam can\'t join due to fever, but he supported Remolty in planning and everything \ud83e\udd17.\\n\\n![Niyas V Session](../static/img/blog/2025-04-19-ilab-tinkerspace-event/Niyas-design-dession.JPG)\\n\\nI also got an opportunity to show LED and mini-motor to a 1 year old baby.\\n\\n\\n<iframe\\n  src=\\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIs0dbupexV/embed\\"\\n  width=\\"400\\"\\n  height=\\"480\\"\\n  frameborder=\\"0\\"\\n  scrolling=\\"no\\"\\n  allowtransparency=\\"true\\">\\n</iframe>\\n\\n----\\nThanks, TinkerSpace Kochi team, Jasim Cm, Reema Shaji and Eldho Sabu for managing everything and the support.

However, it has been challenging to secure speakers, especially for hardware-related subjects. To address this, we shared information about the event during our Maker Thursday gatherings, where we meet at TinkerSpace Kochi every Thursday to discuss various making activities. We also mentioned the difficulty in finding speakers, and as a result, some of our members volunteered to conduct sessions themselves.\\n\\n![Speaker Photo grid](../static/img/blog/2025-04-11-arduino-day-2024-kochi/day-grid-photo.png)\\n\\n\\n\ud83d\udc4f We would like to extend our gratitude to our amazing speakers.

With their support. I was able to take part in the Fab23 international conference.\\n\\nFAB23 Bhutan is the 19th edition of the largest global digital fabrication event. This event connects makers, inventors, academics, and entrepreneurs with a shared goal. This goal is to co-create pathways for our shared future using technology as a platform.\\n\\nDuring the conference, the Makergram community and I conducted a workshop. The workshop titled \u201cBuild smart projects with TinyML using Edge Impulse and Blues Wireless\u201d showcased the power of machine learning on microcontrollers. With the Blues wireless offering, participates could speed up their journey from idea to product.\\n\\n![BluesAtFab23](../static/img/blog/2023-09-09-blues-at-fab23/event-time.png)\\n\\nUpon my arrival in Bhutan, I assessed cellular connectivity using the Notecard in tandem with the Notecarrier-F board, while utilizing B-mobile. B-mobile is the pioneering mobile communications service introduced by Bhutan Telecom in 2003.\\n\\n![BluesAtFab23](../static/img/blog/2023-09-09-blues-at-fab23/blues-test-at-bhutan.png)\\n\\nI confirmed I was able to connect, and I sent data to Notehub without any issues. Luckily, B-Mobile has coverage in the majority of Bhutan. I even had B-Mobile connection while hiking to Bhutan\'s largest Bhudh temple and to tiger nest.\\n\\nAfter completing the coverage test, I worked on the workshop materials. You can access the guides prepared for this [workshop here](https://workshop.makergram.com/docs/category/tinyml-workshop).\\n\\nDuring the workshop, we built a project called \u201c*Activity Sense \u2728 - Human Activity Monitor*\u201d. SeeedStudio graciously sponsored the XIAO nRF52840 modules essential for the workshop. With these modules, we were able to execute tinyML inferences on the XIAO platform. We also transmitted the results to the cloud using the blues.io WiFi notecard.\\n\\nI documented all the workshop steps on [MakerGram](https://workshop.makergram.com/docs/tiny-ml-workshop/ActivitySense), so anyone can follow and complete it if they have the hardware.\\n\\n![BluesAtFab23](../static/img/blog/2023-09-09-blues-at-fab23/day1_workshop.png)\\n\\n\\nThe first workshop took place on day 1 of the Fab23 festival held in Thimpu, the capital of Bhutan.\\n\\nWe hosted 9 participates and several extra people visited during the worksop. We started with an introduction to Arduino, Edge impulse, Blues and Seeed XIAO nRF52840. Then we started work on the project.\\n\\nParticipants followed the steps I documented in MakerGram and worked at their own pace. I also worked through the project at the same time, so participants could follow along. It was an awesome experience interacting with participants from all over the world and introducing them to tinyML and Blues.\\n\\n![BluesAtFab23](../static/img/blog/2023-09-09-blues-at-fab23/otherEvents.png)\\n\\nI interacted with a variety of people from students, faculty, and industry experts.\\n\\n![BluesAtFab23](../static/img/blog/2023-09-09-blues-at-fab23/tigerNest.png)\\n\\nAside from conducting the workshop, I was able to enjoy some free time. I got a chance to hike to Paro Taktsang and Taktsang Palphug Monastery. I also hiked to the Tiger\'s Nest with my friends. I was able to observe that the majority of Bhutan has high cellular coverage. Even on the top of the Paro Taktsang, we received cellular coverage and the network speed was good.\\n\\n![BluesAtFab23](../static/img/blog/2023-09-09-blues-at-fab23/second-workshop.png)\\n\\nDue to a request, I gave one more session on tinyML at the end of the conference day, and it went very well.\\n\\nIn the end, we got very positive feedback from the participants \ud83e\udd17, Thanks to my friends and mentors Adrian (Fab Foundation) ,Eric (SeeedStudio),Jinger (hackster),Jogin(Fablab kerala),Mufeed(Fablab kerala),Praveen(Fablab kerala),Saheen(NASSCOM),Shibu(Fab Foundation),Sibin(Fablab kerala), Swalah(Makergram) and Violet(SeeedStudio) for all the support throughout the event and journey.

I\u2019ve been part of the hackathon as IoT/Hardware mentor with [makergram community](https://community.makergram.com/).\\n\\nOpenHack is very different from normal hackathon, in normal hackathon, it\u2019s all about competition and everyone building a different solution, but here every single one working on the same problem and the same solution collaboratively. \ud83e\udd70\\n\\n> After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul\u2019s indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. \u2014 William R.\\n\\n\\n![OpenHack2019](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/IoT-team-photo.png)\\n_IoT Team_\\n\\n\\n> Various states in India has been struggling due to natural calamities, taking away from us our brothers and sisters and forcing the rest out of their day to day life and to the relief camps with no adequate food, clothing and shelter. This is something that happens every year on a global scale.\\n\\n> As educated youth we simply can\u2019t stand on the borders of safety and watch the world burn. We decided to help by doing what we do best- Code! OpenHack aims to build a Free Platform that can be used by governments and communities who are suffering from natural calamities to organize coordinate relief activities. So this is an open call all technologists, enthusiasts, students, makers and hobbyists to come together to rebuild EARTH. At OpenHack we will only be developing a single project, with Web and Mobile Clients.\\n\\n## Objective\\n\\nOpenHackthon is mainly focused on Software Solution for the first time but later extended to hardware too because hardware prototype needs hardware component we can\u2019t import/download from the web also good mentorship too, each decision is important.\\n\\nwe had a poll in our Openhack participant\u2019s group regarding the tech stack.\\n\\n![Initial Poll](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/initial_poll.png)\\n\\nsurprisingly we had 23% of people interest from in IoT \ud83e\udd18, and after that Shyam gave a brief about the hackathon.\\n\\n![Team Split](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/team_split.png)\\n\\n## IoT Team\\n\\nI was one of the mentor for the **IoT team**, the main goal to keep every on the same page and build a feasible solution using IoT technologies and important thing is documentation, so we can\u2019t complete it someone can use the docs and complete it.\\n\\nThe hack begins: due to some problem, I couldn\'t attend Innaguaration ceremony, Inauguration and Keynote Dr Chitra S and our KSUM CEO Dr Saji Sir, IT Secretary Sivasankar sir etc.\\n\\nafter the inauguration the hackathon started , I gave some time to my teammates to know each other \ud83d\ude05 (I was late)\\n\\n![Ice Breaking Session](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/IoT-team-ice-breaking.png)\\n\\nwe started with writing down the problem statement ( we didn\u2019t get any specific problem statement), so we listed some problems and divided into three categories: Before the flood, During the Flood, After the flood.\\n\\nAfter team discussion and searching on the internet we found that predicting the flood will help reduce the emergencies and help people to evacuate quickly , so we focused on the Before the flood situation and we found that the only requirement is lacking enough data to predict the flood after discussion with back-end team, they also build the prediction solution but lack of data they didn\u2019t continue .\\n\\n## BrainStorming\\n\\n![BrainStroming](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/brainstrom.png)\\n\\nAfter discussion the Backend team, they listed some sensor parameters that required to do the prediction . and they also need data from two different sources one is Dam and another one is a river.\\n\\nDam data is already available from Kerala SLDC so we don\u2019t need to build any hardware to measure that , but there are two problems one the frequency and amount of data collection is not enough to predict another one is getting large amount data we need to go through some long-term procedure, so we planned to contact the SLDC team regarding that we can move further .\\n\\nLive river data is not available anywhere , meanwhile Dam data is on pause we can build the river sensor nodes that can collect real-time data and send back to the prediction team . backend prediction team gave some sensor parameters they need to do the prediction , the parameters are River Water level, Water Flow Speed, Rain Gauge ..etc .\\n\\nSo now we got the exact problem statement and what we need to do, that is to collect the data requested by the backend team to predict the flood due to river overflow .next we need to find the sensor\u2019s to read the parameters and establish a feasible communication between the sensor to send the data.\\n\\n## Design prototype\\n\\n![Prototype Diagram](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/prototype_diagram.png)\\n\\nOur team listed many sensors and methods to grab the data that we required, unfortunately, it\u2019s a hackathon and we need to complete the MVP on tomorrow evening, most of the requested sensors are not available in our personal inventory so we decided to go with what we have and implement our own sensors and measuring methods .\\n\\nFor the River Water level data we have two options one is Accelerometer inside an enclosed ball and based on the acceleration data measure the water level and another one is using Ultrasonic sensor to keep monitor water level by measuring the water surface distance . after discussion with our team and some of the friends we decided to go with the ultrasonic sensor , and yes we have the HCSR04 Ultrasonic model , it\u2019s not the best one it will do the job .\\n\\n![HCSR04](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/hcsro4.png)\\n\\n## Prototyping\\n\\nFor the Water Flow Speed we looked into the internet, we found many but due to availability we can\u2019t use that so one of the members suggested to use DC motor with propeller set up and read the voltage that is proportional to the flow rate also two of the guys says they will take care of the Water Flow sensor building (happy moment )\\n\\nFor the Rain Gauge, one of member hey guy\u2019sRafi got the sensor module to measure the rain intensity but that\u2019s not an accurate rain gauge but we something is better than nothing so we are planning to go with the sensor Rafi have.\\n\\n## Network\\n\\nNext Network , as we know before flood everything good no issues with network (cellular) no power outage issues, so we discussed available network systems like wifi, gsm, SigFox, LoRa ..etc and luckily we have some of the modules also with us , we have 2 LoRa , GSM\\\\NB-IoT , WiFI dev kits (NodeMCU based on popular esp8266) . so quick and easiest build platform NodeMCU because it\u2019s based on Arduino, many members are worked with that before , but the problem with NodeMCU is it based on wifi and we are going to install at the river shore, yeah we don\u2019t have wifi access point on the riverside or we need to install a wifi modem in the riverside so just skipped the wifi (will back into this) . another thing we can use is LoRa WAN, LoRa is Powerful network and built specifically for the Connected things that work on low energy and low power, but LoRa wan need a gateway to communicate with server , unfortunately we don\u2019t have a gateway but we planned to do one Lora as node and another module act as gateway to the server . another good thing none of them we worked with LoRa or didn\u2019t get a chance to work with that, so this is the time.\\n\\n## Server\\n\\nServer connection, now we figure it out what data we need and which sensor we need to use and how what network we are using, we need to give the data to the backend team, they need the data to be a JSON structure , and they asked us to make an API to access the data . so instead of sending data directly to the server we are sending to the server via API so anyone in the public can use that data via another API, that makes sense, everyone can get the information. So since none of them didn\u2019t have a server we plan to go with firebase, one of our member Alex Jolly shows interest to set up the firebase, he will structure the data and the database and provide an API to the backend team. Great!\\n\\n![GKR Helping to Setup Server](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/gkr-helping-to-setup-server.png)\\n\\n## Team Split\\n\\nTeam division, we divided the team into different parts based on what they are working, one team working on Water Flow sensor, they building own water flow meter, one team focused on LoRa implementation and the funny part is everyone\u2019s interest to be part of Lora since everyone wants to learn LoRa. another team worked on nodemcu implementation as a backup (yeah we had a backup plan), we planned to use cellular but didn\u2019t try due to time limitation .another team worked on documentation they also part of the Lora team too.\\n\\nFireBase team was successfully mocked the data using a python script, but they stuck to get data to the backend team . meanwhile with support my friend GKR ( Gautham Krishna r) I was trying to build an API using NodeJS and Express, we used MongoDB but due to small server config the MongoDB is crashed, I used digital ocean $5 Linux Droplet, but it was a great learning for me. Big thanks to GKR.\\n\\nAfter the hard work of the firebase team, we successfully passed the data to the backend team via API (we called Alex errorless API).\\n\\n## LoRa\\n\\n![LoRa Team is looking for Bug](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/Lora-team-debugging.png)\\n_LoRa Team is looking for Bug \ud83d\udc1b_\\n\\nIn Lora, due some issues we can\u2019t establish the communication between two nodes , but it was a great learning for the team, In the first, team spend hours to find out the error and they successfully debugged the Lora receiver part, but we stuck at sending part, we \u2018ll find out and document it later.\\n\\nAs you know we had a backup with NodeMCU, we successful published the Ultrasonic data to firebase via wifi then we got an enclosure from my inventory, that comes with the RAK5010 Cellular Module, the good thing about the enclosure is fully waterproof and comes with a small solar panel.\\n\\n![RAK Enclosure](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/RAK_enclosure.png)\\n\\nAt the End: we used the Adafruit ESP8266 Feather board, which I got from hackster as a gift. it has an inbuilt LipO charging circuit so we can directly plug into that LipO battery that comes with RAK5010.\\n\\nwe sucessly full send data to the cloud from the sensor to firebase, from the firebase using API backend team will get the data for predicting\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nOur solution\u2019s not the best, but we will keep working to make it feasible. we are refracting and documenting our code, please keep an eye on our Github repo: [github.com/RiverMonitoringSystem](https://github.com/RiverMonitoringSystem)\\n\\nif you want to contribute the solution to please check out [gitlab.com/rebuildearth](https://gitlab.com/rebuildearth)\\n\\n\\n## Some Awesome Moments\\n\\n![Midnight Diwali celebration](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/divali_celebration.png)\\n_Midnight Diwali celebration_\\n\\n![Midnight Diwali celebration](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/divali_celebration2.png)\\n\\n![Midnight madness \ud83d\udc83](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/midnight_madness.gif)\\n_Midnight madness \ud83d\udc83_\\n\\n![Long Discussions](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/long-discussion.png)\\n_long discussions \ud83d\udde3_\\n\\n\\n![sleeping is our superpower](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/sleeping_is_our_superpower.png)\\n_sleeping is our superpower \ud83e\udd2b_\\n\\nmeanwhile, we introduced MakerFaire Hyderbad to our fellow participants with super awesome MFHYD Students lead Anlee and Rafi\\n\\n![sleeping is our superpower](../static/img/blog/2019-10-29-open-hack-2019/mfhyd_Intro.png)\\n_sleeping is our superpower \ud83e\udd2b_\\n\\n\\nBig Thanks to all the people who support us, It was truly AWESOME \ud83e\udd70.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Update\\n\\n**24/10/2019** : We are still working on the solution and currently try to build a stable hardware , you can find the meeting log here: https://community.makergram.com/topic/65/openhack-open-river-monitoring-system-for-flood-prediction"}]}}')}}]);
